Currently we are using the Unity editor's solution for the code in the game.  However, any external funcs or libs could be added into here and then used in the Unity editor's solution.

Libraries are being copied into the Unity Scene's Assets\libs folder via copylibs.cmd in the root of the solution structure for GalaxyGame.
